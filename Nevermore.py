                            1. Include ALL significant topics covered
                            2. If something specific such a technique or methodology is mentioned, this is very important to include
                            3. If the video is an introduction to a topic, ensure the written lesson is an introduction as well, DON'T include code from later in the course.
                            4. ALL code should be formatted on new lines as:
                            ```javascript
